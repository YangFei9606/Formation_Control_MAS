# Formation_Control_MAS
Time-varying formation control of MAS

07 July, 2021 Updated

The very first file of this project is uploaded.

The file four_bots_CNN_DSM_7.slx is the simulation file for my first journal article:
Fei, Y., Shi, P. and Lim, C.C., 2020. Neural network adaptive dynamic sliding mode formation control of multi-agent systems. International Journal of Systems Science, 51(11), pp.2025-2040.
For those who are interested in the paper, there are several typos I made:
1. Equation (39): It should be L(rho_i) - e_{xi}(0)
2. Table 2: The orientation of the first rover should be pi/4
3. The rotation matrix in (42): The element on the second row and the third column should be -cos(pi/3 + theta)

The code is free from the problems mentioned above and you can try it by simply clicking Run.

Although it's my first paper, I'm not quite satisfied with it now because the method I implemented is a bit complex and ideal. But it should be something that can offer the ones that conduct research on multi-agent system, sliding mode control and neural network based control some inspiration. 

3 months ago, my second paper was also accepted and published. Hope those who are interested can have a look.
